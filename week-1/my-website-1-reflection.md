## Explain how to create a repo in Github and clone to a non-technical person.

Well, first off, a repository is like a folder on your computer, one you might keep documents or pictures in. What makes a repository (repo) different, however, is that it is equipped with something called git, which allows one to track changes while coding. Github is a service where one can create and store repositories remotely from the computer. It's very easy to create one: all you have to do is create a github profile and navigate to the "+" icon in the top right hand corner to create a new repo. Github will ask you to name it and set some settings and after that, boom, you'e got a repo. Now, that repo you just created, that only exists on Github, currently. What if you want that repo on your local computer? Well, here we use the ability to clone. Each repo you createon Github has a HTTPS link, which is used for cloning. To clone, copy that HTTPS link from the main page of your repo. Then, open up your computer's command line interface (what developers use to speak with a computer) and navigate to a folder where you would like to clone the repo from Github. Once there, use the command "git clone github link." And there you go, you've clone the repo from Github to your local computer and can begin working.

## Describe open source

Open source refers to code that is able to be shared/edited/looked at by the general public. The code can be cloned to one's computer and tinkered with, leading to new creations the original writer of the code may or may not have intended.

## What do you think of open source code?

I think open source code is a pretty neat thing, if the original write of the code intends it to be shared. It can certainly lead to harmful situations if someone malicious gets there hands on the code and manipulates it to something that can infiltrate unsuspecting users, but I think that's where one has to have some common sense before downloading something to their computer. I just feel like the decision/idea to make something open source is in the court of the creator, and if they think their project/program should be seen/edited by anyone in the public, then that's their perogative.

## Assess importance of using a license

Licensing allows the creator to determine how the public can view/use what that person has made (whether it's code, music, movie, etc). This is incredibly important because it gives the creator the option to retain as much or as little control over their creation. With an MIT License, or a CC Attribution (only) license, the creator is basically saying "Public: do what you will with what I have created, I pretty much don't care"; but with a GPL license, the creator is saying "You can change stuff, but you can't make what I created private, it is still free for all to use even if you changed it". Again, this is critical because it essentially determines how a project will morph and be seen by anyone who comes in contact with it.

## What concepts were soldified? A-ha moment? Anything struggled with?

I'm really starting to get the hang of using the command line to create new branches to my master branch, commiting any changes, and then pushing those changes up to Github (and making sure to sync those changes locally afterwards). Right now, it's a lot of syntax that's holding me down and I hope to have it memorized soon. For example, I was trying to push a branch up to Github and I was like "wait, crap, I've been editing on the master branch this whole time, we only learned the steps for editing on a feature branch, what do I do?" So I took a breath and was like, OK, I can still push this baby up to Github no problem. Wait, why am I getting error messages? Oh, I forgot the word "origin", that's the issue? It's little things like that that make me realize I just need more practice and use with these commands. No "A-Ha" just yet; nothing that monumental has happened so far.

## Found other resources?

I haven't had a lot of time to really dive deep and look at resources outside of the ones provided in the modules due to work (this has been one of the most abnormal hell weeks I've ever experienced, I know it'll get better from here). I have begun reading Chris Pine's "Learn to Program" book to get my feet wet and review some things to keep me fresh in the early stages of Phase 0.
