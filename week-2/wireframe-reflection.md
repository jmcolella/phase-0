## What is a wireframe?

Whereas a site map shows the main branches and full layout of a website, a wireframe gets into the details of the layour for each page of a website. It can be as detailed or minimal as needed, depending on the work flow of the individual person. The only goal of a wireframe is to communicate a rough sketch of a particular webpage in order to have some direction when writing out the HTML/CSS.

## What are the benefits of wireframing?

Certainly one benefit is that a wireframe provides a bird's eye, graphical view for one to consult before diving into writing code. In some ways, it can be a picture of the end goal for that particular webpage, allowing for the code to kind of fall into place, rather than trying to imagine the end goal in HTML elements and attributes (which could be quite challenging). Just like a site map, a wireframe is like a road map for your code; it can certainly help you get started and provide a guide while coding. This is not to say a wireframe is the end-all-be-all of the webpage's design, but, to me, it helps to get the juices flowing outside of the context of HTML/CSS.

## Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Since I'm a pretty visual person and really enjoy design, I did have a good time wireframing. I used Mockingbird to create my two wireframes, and I found the interface fun and simple to use, and it just let me kind of explore with different shapes, texts and sizes to determine the type of layout I wanted. I'll probably wireframe for the rest of my career, it definitely helped me to visualize what I want to see as the end product of my code.

## Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I think I had a general idea of what I wanted and most of it came through in my wireframe. Things like the social media buttons were added on when I discovered them in the Mockingbird element area and using the lines to separate the header and footer of my page was a new idea as well, influenced by Mockingbird. The blog page I had no idea what I was going for, particularly because we an't just put the posts on the page for the time being. That I went through a few iterations, moving around the post links, trying to find a good balance of text/images/negative space. I still don't know how I feel about it, but maybe if the link descriptions are longer, they will take up more space and provide a pleasing aesthetic.

## What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I didn't really have any questions. The idea of wireframing was pretty straight forward once I read about it in the readings on Canvas. The only question I had was how to use Mockingbird, but I kind of just fiddled around with the interface and figured out how to use it (that is usually my preferred method of problem solving).

## Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I really liked wireframing. If I end up working on the front end after DBC, I will definitely invest in a wireframing software because I think it's a great visual aid and jumping off point to see the goal before diving into the code. That really jives with my visually-oriented way of thinking. I found bits of the "Beginner's Guide to Wireframing" irrelevant and unnecessary, so I kept jumping around to pick out the pieces that were pertinent for me.
