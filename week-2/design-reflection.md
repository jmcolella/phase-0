## What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of web design are: 1) gather information, 2) plan, 3) design, 4) develop, 5) test and delivery and 6) maintanence. The first two phases involve answering major questions about the purpose of the website and determining how the layout (using a site map) will help achieve that purpose when a user visits the website. Design and Develop are led by the developer making the website, but still involve a lot of input from the website owner. Here, the actually website itself takes shape with the HTML/CSS being written out and portions of the website are either available to be viewed or tested by the owner. The fifth phase comes towards the end, when the website is basically ready to be made public. Here, the developer/owner of the site fine tune the details of the website and iron out any issues they may encounter. The last phase involves regular updating and general caretaking of the website once it has gone live. This can be done by a highered developer, or using previously agreed upon tools by the owner

## What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary purpose is to provide pertinent professional information about myself to users. This includes my primary contact information, list of projects, resume and social media accounts. I want to prominently feature my projects and resume, with contact information very easy to access at any time. Social media accounts are important, but are not the focus of this website and are merely there for further information if a user so desires to find out.

## What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

Hopefully the interests of my audience are to hire me! They will be looking for my resume/project portfolio to judge if I have the capable skills necessary to be hired. Contact information is also key, in case they need to reach out to me. So, as I mentioned in my previous answer, these three pieces of information will be very easy to find and navigate between on my site, since I believe them to be the most important. In addition, I want to make sure my site isn't cluttered and has a natural "flow" for the user. I'm currently not sure how to accomplish that, but I hope to find out soon.

## What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action should be to locate my resume and portfolio. I want to have these as two individual buttons/tabs, that will be placed towards the top left of the screen, which I believe will be a natural point for the user's eyes to begin. Contact information is a close secondary action, and I will be sure to have a link available for this information on every page a user navigates to.

## What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

First and foremost, user experience is not usability. Whereas usability is concerned with the user friendliness and efficiency of the webpage interface, user experience seeks to get at the psychology and emotions of the user when visiting a webpage. In that regard, UX is a bit more complex and complicated, where simple statistics don't necessarily tell the whole picture of what a user is feeling. It seems, though, that UX designers try to merge statistics with psychology, using those stats as a jumping off point to hypothesize about what users are feeling, and then they can implement that hypothesis in experiments or through research. It appears to be a very interesting field, that is maybe somewhat underappreciated, that seeks to find the human element amongst all of the HTML/CSS.

## What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design  uses knowledge about how a user feels when navigating a website to make design changes to further optimize that website. Although it's hard to quantify how a user "feels," UX designers have a few tools that uses statistics to try and glean how a website makes a user feel. For example, UX designers can use what is called A/B software to compile data about how to different iterations of the same site effect a user's experience. This software charts the experience with data points, and any differences can be analyzed by UX designers to determine which iteration best serves the user (whose interests are usually tied with that of the owner of the website). UX design is valuable because it brings a human element to a very technological field and helps to provide a more holistic, possibly natural, perspective on how a website is organized and designed. UX designers also seem to help separate the values of the website's owner from the values of the website's users to create an experience that is less about one person's interests and opinions and more about the interests and opinions of the people the website is serving. This is incredibly important for company's who are trying to sell products to a certain audience, and UX design can help save large amounts of money.

## Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I kind of found making the site map to be a bit tedious. I guess I just wasn't happy with the method I chose (Slickplan). Maybe if I just draw it out, I might enjoy the process better.

I also had a hard time with using the markdown language to get my site map image inline on my reflection text. All the resources I searched about using markdown to display an image use a webpage address for the image file. Well, I thought we were supposed to save the image as a file on our local computer? How does the markdown language work then? I'll try to dig deeper on this subject, I'm just not understanding it right now.
