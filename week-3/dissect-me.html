      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my first post on my Dev Bootcamp blog! I'm excited to share what I've been learning and hopefully someone out there may actually find this helpful.

        In this first post, I'm going to be discussing the very basics of git, Github and version control.These three things go hand-in-hand with each other and provide software developers with many tools to edit and share code. Let's start with talking about git and version control (which are very closely related) and then we'll move on to discuss Github. You ready? I hope so...

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  We used the section tag, which I find myself returning to often because it best helps me understand how I want the page to flow. What I mean is that section tabs, because they create sections, help me organize the content of my page and then place them within the HTML in the same way I would want them presented on the actual web page.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  Elements get laid out on a page in the order that they are written in HTML.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  I learned the 2 things that were highlighted for Sublime in this challenge: the html tab "snippet" and the create your own snippet featue. I thought creating a snippet was incredibly handy and really cool, and I would like to utilize that feature when I become more comfortable with HTML and know what I want from my strucutre every time I write an HTML document.
