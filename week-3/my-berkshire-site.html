What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was a great experience to actually put to use what we've learned so far.
  Actually, that's how I learn best: by being taught a concept and then just diving in on my own
  (or with someone else) to really make those concepts stick. The Berkshire Hathaway website was a
  great starting point because, since it's so simple, I could actually visualize the HTML just by
  looking at the page, which was helpful to reinforce the idea of semantic HTML5 and just getting
  a feel for how HTML translates into the structure of a website.

How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  I'm really loving semantic HTML5. To me, it just makes sense, and I would have tried to arrange my
  HTML in the manner of semantic HTML5 even if it didn't exist. To be able to clearly separate the
  webpage's structure into header, footer, sections, articles, asides, just allows for a great deal
  of organization that will greatly help when styling that HTML, or even just reading it. I found
  the resource Shay Howe Learn to Code HTML & CSS to be particularly helpful in learning semantic
  HTML5 and understanding how to implement it.

How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I think my pair and I did a great job of not formatting anything. I know for me, at least, I
  followed DBC's instruction to skip anything relating to formatting within HTML, so I don't even
  know how to do it. With this Berkshire Hathaway clone, though, formatting is barely a component
  of the site itself, so my pair and I really saw no need to add anything extra besides the bare
  bones HTML structure.

What seems good and bad about HTML?
  The good? Structure, and lots of it. As I've mentioned before, I'm a stickler for organization,
  and the way HTML is meant to be read, organization of tags/elements is of the utmost importance.
  With different elements like header, section, list, table, article, footer, and many others, HTML
  seems to be made for creating structure and providing a foundation for other stuff. Now, that
  other stuff (CSS, Javascript) is where HTML is bad at. HTML is really really bad at making a
  website look good. I mean, it was originally developed to transmit pure text files across a
  private internet connection, so you can't really blame it much for not being able to style. You could
  format text/images using HTML, but that can get really cluttered really fast, so at least HTML allows
  you to link a different, more stylistically minded language to the HTML file so you can create a really
  beautiful, structurally sound webpage. That's another thing HTML is good at: allowing a developer to
  link to another language for formatting, which helps to keep the structurally integrity and readability
  of the HTML in tact.

What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I don't really have any tricks, per se, but it's certainly easy to remember that HTML involves tags
  because I fell like they're pretty unique to the language. So I just always remember that a tag needs an
  opening and a close (except for those 10 or so instances where it does not, like for <img> or <link>) and
  I'm good to go. I like sandwiches a lot, and HTML feels a lot like a sandwich, because everything that
  appears on the final page in the browser is "sandwiched" between tags. Even though whole HTML file itself
  is a sandwich between the opening and closing <html> tag. Actually, I guess that's my trick for remembering
  HTML: you always need tags (bread) or else HTML can't be read (it's not a sandwich, it's something else, like
  a salad. No one likes salads).
